# Search-bar

This is made  by  using REACT.JS .
<br>
A website search bar is a bar that (typically) lives in the top navigation of a website and allows users to search for content rather than browse your website using the given navigation options. The user clicks the search bar, types in a query, and clicks “search”, the magnifying glass icon. Similar to searching on a search engine like Google, results appear below, based on the closest match available to the word or words used in the query.

### Summary (Final Results!)
As with anything related to website design, providing a positive user experience is key. Determining whether a website search bar would be helpful or a hindrance must be decided by your company, through identifying your audience needs, your type of website, and your company’s goals. If you have identified user journey pathways for more control over the user experience, you should set out to create a site using the menu rather than through the website search bar. If a search bar can help you reach your goals, finetune your design and results using data-backed analytics so your website can give your user exactly what they’re looking for.
